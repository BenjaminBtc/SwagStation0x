#SwagStation0x:

Provides a decentralized market for users to buy and sell crypto merchandise.
Users to the SwagStation0x platform will be able to discover their favorite crypto softgoods, memes, tech hardware and other promotional/exclusive items. 

By utilizing d0xINFRA, SwagStation0x will establish a simple, yet functional marketplace allowing users access to the following features;
-Creation of a Swag/Merchandise listing
-Simple navigation and the ability for users to search for items of interest
-A system for users to upvote/downvote unappealing/unwanted/inappropriate merchandise.
-Secure payment


Once  the user creates a profile and login, they are then granted access to buy and post merchandise to the marketplace. Items can be purchased directly with ethereum or with their Flow/Dappper account. Users can also search and filter marketplace, rank peers and build a reputation. Swag is listed in the marketplace at a fixed cost and duration is unlimited or until sale is canceled by user/host. An item for sale will include the sale price, quantity available, and approximate weight to calculate shipping.


Ranking and reputation; token distributed at 1:1000 (Payout ratio subject to change) with amount of purchase/sale (in ETH)


Shipping of swag/merchandise will be conducted through the Flow blockchain; This will allow for private shipping. Users of Flow have already completed KYC and therefore multiple platforms will not hold users private information. SwagStation0x will utilize the DANK token, or comparable reputation token to allow users to provide feedback on service provided by users of the platform. The purpose here is to create a token to demonstrate users reputation rather than a monetary value. SwagStation0x will employ the Flow blockchain to accommodate transactions and the exchange of funds/goods.


New auxiliary modules developed on District0x will be utilized in the marketplace to enhance the user experience in ways including but not limited to verification of authenticity for higher end swag and collectibles, secure shipping, and even ways to see trending companies swag offerings.
