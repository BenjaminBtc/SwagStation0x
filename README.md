#SwagStation0x:

SwagStation0x provides a decentralized marketplace for users to buy and sell blockchain merchandise. Users to the SwagStation0x platform will be able to discover their favorite crypto soft goods, memes, tech hardware and other promotional/exclusive items. Not only will SwagStation0x be an awesome place for users to find their favorite blockchain gear, it will also be act as a promotional hub for blockchain projects to gain community exposure.

By utilizing d0xINFRA, SwagStation0x will establish a simple, yet functional marketplace allowing users access to the following features;

-Creation of a Swag/Merchandise listing
-Simple navigation and the ability for users to search for items of interest
-A system for users to upvote/downvote unappealing and/or inappropriate merch.
-Secure payment and shipping protocol

Once the user creates a profile and login, they are then granted access to buy and post merchandise to the marketplace. Items can be purchased directly with ethereum or with their Dappper account(Payment options pending). Users can also search and filter marketplace items, rank peers and build a reputation with their contributions to the marketplace. Swag is listed in the marketplace at a fixed cost and duration is unlimited or until sale is canceled by user/host. An item for sale will include the sale price, quantity available, and approximate weight to calculate shipping.

Ranking and reputation; token distributed at 1:100 (Payout ratio subject to change) with amount of purchase/sale (in ETH). The reputation-based token will allow users to provide feedback on service provided by users of the platform and will also be redeemable for SwagStation0x "freebies", promotional items and enhanced market place features for host users.

New auxiliary modules developed on District0x will be utilized in the marketplace to enhance the user experience in ways including but not limited to verification of authenticity for higher end swag and collectibles, secure shipping, and more ways to provide incentive to users hosting items in the marketplace.
